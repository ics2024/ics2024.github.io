<br><br><strong>Anonymity</strong><br><br>
Submissions (both abstract and paper) should be prepared for double-blind review, i.e., without author names or other
identifying material. The submission system requests information about the authors. This information will not be given
to the reviewers. Authors should refer to themselves in the third person when citing their own work. Authors should
under no circumstances reveal their identity or affiliation through any side channels, including but not limited to the
metadata of the submitted PDF files, their prior work, or acronyms of systems which have already been released to the
public. If you are improving upon your prior work, refer to your prior work in the third person and include a full
citation for the work in the bibliography. For example, if you are building on your own prior work in, you would say
something like: "While the authors of~\cite{your prior work } did X, Y, and Z, this paper additionally does W, and is
therefore much better." Do NOT omit or anonymize references for blind review. There is one exception to this for your
own prior work that appeared in Computer Architecture Letters, arXiv, workshops without archived proceedings, etc. as
discussed later in this document.<br><br>

If authors have any doubts on whether any aspect of their submission violates anonymity they should contact the Program
Chairs. Authors may contact only the Program Chairs for any matters regarding submitted papers during and after the
review process. Contacting PC or ERC members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and grounds for immediate
rejection of the paper.<br><br>

<strong>Declaring Authors</strong><br><br>

Declare all the authors of the paper upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the paper is accepted will have to be
approved by the program chair, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer
assignment.<br><br>

<strong>Areas and Topics</strong><br><br>

Authors should indicate specific topics covered by the paper on the submission page. If you are unsure whether your
paper falls within the scope of the conference, please check with the program chair --- ICS is a broad,
multidisciplinary conference and encourages new topics.<br><br>

<strong>Declaring Conflicts of Interest</strong><br><br>

Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate
assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found
to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or `game' the review system, the paper may be rejected.<br><br>

Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper.
A conflict occurs in the following cases:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Between advisor and advisee forever.</li><br>
  <li>Between family members forever.</li><br>
  <li>Between people who have collaborated in the last 5 years. This collaboration can consist of a joint research or
    development project, a joint paper, or when there is direct funding from the potential reviewer (as opposed to
    company
    funding) to an author of the paper. Co-participation in professional activities, such as tutorials or studies, is
    not
    cause for conflict. When in doubt, the author should check with the Program Chair.</li><br>
  <li>Between people from same institution (including when the authors are in negotiation about accepting a position at
    an
    institution) or who were in the same institution in the last 5 years.</li><br>
  <li>Between people whose relationship prevents the reviewer from being objective in his/her assessment.</li><br>
</ul>

`Service' collaborations, such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee,
or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium
of various projects with no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of
the different projects. On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI
exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration which has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please
report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI
with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The program
chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.<br><br>

Most reviews will be solicited among the members of the PC, but other members from the community may also write reviews.
Please declare all your conflicts (not just restricted to the PC) on the submission form. When in doubt, contact the
program chair.<br><br>

<strong>ArXiv Submissions</strong><br><br>

Authors may submit their work to ICS 2024 for publication even if the paper has been submitted to or currently appears
on Arxiv. However, please do recognize that Arxiv submissions cause serious issues with the double-blind review process.
The PC chair will advise the PC members not to consider Arxiv submissions in their evaluation. However, we encourage the
authors to reduce the possibility of their name being disclosed. While there is no magical solution to hide from the
power of web search in locating Arxiv papers, we encourage authors to avoid substantially similar titles abstract etc.,
to reduce this match.<br><br>

<strong>Concurrent Submissions and Workshops</strong><br><br>

By submitting a manuscript to ICS 2024, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or
accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or the archived proceedings of a
workshop (e.g., in the ACM/IEEE digital libraries) --- see exceptions below. The authors also guarantee that no paper
that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper will be under review for any other
conference or journal or an archived proceedings of a workshop during the review period. Violation of any of these
conditions will lead to rejection.<br><br>

The only exceptions to the above rules are for the authors' own papers in (1) workshops without archived proceedings
such as in the ACM/IEEE digital libraries (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived
proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL or arXiv where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not
preclude longer conference submissions. In all such cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the above work to
preserve author anonymity. This information must, however, be provided on the submission form --- the program chair will
make this information available to reviewers if it becomes necessary to ensure a fair review. As always, if you are in
doubt, it is best to contact program chairs. Finally, we also note that the <a
  href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">ACM Plagiarism Policy</a> covers a range of
ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one's own work.<br><br>

<strong>Ethical Obligations</strong><br><br>

<ul>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to encourage or solicit them to bid on any paper.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to attempt to sway a reviewer to review any paper positively or negatively.</li><br>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing
    process, either in general or specifically about submitted papers.
  </li><br>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to ask about the outcomes of any papers.</li><br>
  <li>Authors must also abide by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM ethics policy</a>. Violation of
    the ACM ethics policy may <strong>result in rejection of the
      submission and possible action by the ACM.</strong></li><br>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to advertise their submissions or related technical reports and postings (e.g., to
    arxiv.org or
    online repositories) on social media or community blogs and webpages <strong>during the period starting from the
      submission
      deadline and ending when the ICS acceptance results are public.</strong>
  </li><br>
  <li>ICS follows the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/roles-and-responsibilities">ACM Author
      Representations Policy</a>.</li><br>
</ul>

<strong>Upon Acceptance of Your Paper</strong><br><br>

Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection on the Decision Notification Date. At this point, contact authors of
accepted papers will receive instructions on how to prepare and submit a final version by the Camera-Ready
Deadline.<br><br>

<strong>AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:</strong> The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the
ACM Digital
Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date may
affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are
published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day
of the conference.)<br><br>

<strong>Your Paper at the Conference</strong><br><br>

Authors are required to present their work in a scheduled session with other ICS Papers. Papers whose authors are not at
the conference to present their paper may be removed from the ACM Digital Library.<br><br>

<strong>Acknowledgments</strong><br><br>

Elements in this document regarding concurrent submissions, anonymity, and ethical obligations are taken from previous
SIGARCH conferences, particularly the last two instances of the ASPLOS conference (ASPLOS'22, ASPLOS'21), ICS 2023, the
program chairs of which we wish to thank.
