  Title
  <h4>
    <strong>From Past to Future: The Legacy and Hypothesis of Supercomputing</strong>
  </h4>
</h3>
<h3>
  Abstract
<h4>
  Fujitsu has been at the forefront of supercomputing for nearly 50 years, since the development of the FACOM230-75 APU
supercomputer in 1977. Over the years, Fujitsu has delivered numerous iconic machines such as the NWT (1993), K-computer
(2011), and Fugaku (2020). This keynote speech will begin by showcasing these landmark machines and their unique
features.<p></p>
Next, I will introduce the FUJITSU-MONAKA, a data center CPU scheduled to deploy in 2027. The presentation will explore
how the technologies and lessons learned from supercomputer development are applied to the data center field.<p></p>
We will then delve deeper into the history of supercomputer technology, with a particular focus on architecture.
Supercomputer architecture has undergone three major transitions. Drawing on my own experience, I will explain why these
transitions were necessary and what they aimed to achieve.<p></p>
Finally, I will conclude by sharing personal speculations on the lessons learned from this historical journey and
contemplate the possibilities that lie ahead for supercomputing.

  Title
  <h4>
    <strong>European Supercomputers: Buy versus Build</strong>
  </h4>
</h3>
<h3>
  Abstract
  <h4>
    In 2018 Europe created the EuroHPC initiative and its associated legal funding structure, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking
    with two main objectives. The first objective aims to acquire, build and deploy a world-class High-Performance Computing
    (HPC) infrastructure across Europe. The goal of the second objective is to conduct research and development towards
    building Made in Europe HPC hardware as well as the applications (software) that would run on locally developed future
    European supercomputers.<p></p>
    This talk will cover both objectives in detail. On the one hand, Europe has recently committed a substantial amount of
    money towards the first objective. For example, in the Top-500 list of November 2023, 7 of the supercomputers in the
    Top-20 are from Europe. We will do a deep dive and describe the two main components of the heterogeneous MareNostrum 5
    supercomputer, which are separately listed at the 8th and 19th positions of the Top-500. Installed in our headquarters
    in Barcelona, MareNostrum 5 represents a good exhibit for the challenges of building a contemporary supercomputer; for
    example, the space requirements dictated that BSC could no longer deploy it inside our Church. Accordingly, the
    MareNostrum 5 had to be installed in a larger space; while the Church will be utilized to install our first Quantum
    Computer, thus completing the prophecy made by Dan Brown in his book, Origin.<p></p>
    On the other hand, and as second part of my talk, I will describe the European approach to design Made-in-Europe general
    processors and accelerators leveraging the RISC V Open Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Currently, this approach is
    embodied in a couple of large-scale European research projects, namely the European Processor Initiative, EUPilot,
    Eprocessor as well as some nationally funded projects. I will briefly describe these projects, including the
    proof-of-concept test chips that successfully boots Linux. I will briefly hint at the future and describe the
    initiatives that Europe and BSC are carrying out with the main purpose of developing software and hardware for the
    MareNostrum 6 supercomputer that should be a reality in 2027-2028.

  <h4>
  <strong>LLMs Everywhere: Acceleration from Servers to Mobile Devices in the Age of Generative AI</strong>
  </h4>
</h3>
<h3>
  Abstract
  <h4>
    Large Language Models (LLMs) are a critical milestone on the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). To deliver
    on this promise, all systems must become supercomputers to deliver the processing power behind LLMs, and eventually AGI.
    It was only in 2020 that we first demonstrated the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in production using ASIC and GPU
    accelerators. Since then, accelerators have become the workhorse of AI, delivering sustainability and efficiency
    improvements necessary to deliver on the promise of AI at scale. Given how much is at stake, as a community we are
    exploring exciting new paths that have never been explored, such as low-precision integers, single byte and sub-byte
    floating point representations that were unimaginable until very recently, and ever more sophisticated collective
    protocols.<p></p>
    Combining innovations at the software and hardware levels, the AI, architecture and supercomputing communities have
    delivered several orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency to enable LLM deployment at scale, building on critical
    innovations such as Multiray/Textray that keep our communities safe and deliver on the promise of AI sustainability.
    With the recent announcement of torchchat and ExecuTorch, we are delivering the ability to deploy LLMs from servers to
    desktop and mobile/edge devices.

    <div id="content">
      <p>Dr. Michael Gschwind is a Director / Principal Engineer for PyTorch at Meta Platforms. At Meta, he led the rollout of
      GPU Inference for production services and was the lead for the development of MultiRay and Textray, the first deployment
      of LLMs at scale exceeding 800 billion queries per day shortly after its rollout.</p>
      <div style="display: none;">
        <p>
          Dr. Gschwind has led the deployment of LLMs on ASIC and GPU Accelerators as an industry-first and initiated the
          Accelerated Transformer program (formerly known as "Better Transformer") for PyTorch with critical innovations ranging
          from theory to practice and hardware design to software optimization.<p></p>
          Prior to joining Meta, Michael invented general-purpose programmable accelerators with the Cell chip in 2000 used in the
          PlayStation 3 and Roadrunner, the first Petaflop supercomputer, and led development of the first accelerator software
          stack. Michael was a lead architect for three supercomputers, Roadrunner, BlueGene and Summit, that were the fastest
          system of their day, and for three game consoles bringing supercomputer performance into the home (Cell, Xbox360, Wii).
          Michael led hardware and software architecture for IBM's AI servers, and created and launched IBM's PowerAI
          software/hardware co-designed platform for enterprise AI. He reinvigorated IBM Systems Architecture as Chief Architect
          of IBM Systems for all IBM system brands. He brought supercomputer technologies into the mainstream and initiated and
          led the modernization of mainframe and enterprise servers to support IBM's enterprise AI program. He also served as VP
          and Chief Architect of Accelerated Computing and Intelligent Applications at Huawei.
          <p></p>
          Dr. Gschwind served as faculty member at Princeton and Technische Universität Wien, his alma mater. Dr. Gschwind has
          previously served as Chair of ACM SIGMICRO, and technical program chair of the ACM International Conference on
          Supercomputing (ICS), the IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture, HPCA 2018, and
          ACM/IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT), and ACM Computing
          Frontiers. He is a co-author of over 100 scientific papers and co-inventor of over 1000 US and international patents,
          and an IEEE Fellow.
